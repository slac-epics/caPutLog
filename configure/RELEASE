# IOC apps or other Support apps

# External Support module path definitions
#
# If any of these macros expand to a path which
# contains an "include" directory, that directory will be
# included in the compiler include path.
#
# If any of these macros expand to a path which
# contains a "lib/<arch>" directory, that directory will be
# included in the compiler link path for that architecture.
#
# If your build fails, look for these paths in your build output
# ============================================================
# Ex: IOCADMIN=$(EPICS_MODULES)/iocAdmin/$(IOCADMIN_MODULE_VERSION)

# ===============================================================
# Define the location and version of EPICS base
# Set EPICS_BASE last so it appears last in the DB, DBD, INCLUDE, and LIB search paths
# ===============================================================
