CaPutLog is an EPICS support module that provides logging for Channel Access put operations. 
The current version works with EPICS 3.14.8.2 and later and is almost 
a complete re-write of the original (3.13 compatible) version 
that was written by V. Korobov (DESY). It is based on the generic iocLogClient 
that is part of the EPICS libCom. Starting a log server requires exactly 
the same steps as for the regular iocLogServer, except that you probably 
want to use a different port. 
On the IOC side there are three routines to be called from the iocShell. 
See Section Installation, below.

Installation and Configuration:
============================================================================================================
Change the definition of EPICS_BASE in configure/RELEASE according to the 
location of epics base on the host, then (gnu-)make. 
Add the install directory to your IOC application's configure/RELEASE, 
and in the Makefile add caPutLog.dbd to your dbd includes and caPutLog to the libraries to link.
In your IOC startup file add the command

  caPutLogInit "host[:port]" [config]

where host (mandatory argument) is the IP address or 
host name of the log server and port is optional (the default is 7011). 
The environment variable EPICS_CA_PUT_LOG_ADDR is used if the first 
parameter to caPutLogInit is NULL or the empty string.
The second (optional, default=0) argument should be one of

  #define caPutLogNone        -1  /* no logging (disable) */
  #define caPutLogOnChange    0   /* log only on value change */
  #define caPutLogAll         1   /* log all puts */

Other shell commands are:

caPutLogReconf config
    Change configuration on-line. The argument is the same as in caPutLogInit.

caPutLogShow level
    Show Here, level is the usual interest level (0, 1, or 2).

For the server you can use the same executable as for the regular IOC log server. 
You might want to start another instance with a dfferent port, though. 
However, you can also use the same log server instance 
(so that caput log messages and regular IOC log messages go into the same log file).

Here at SLAC, we will use the same log server instance:
