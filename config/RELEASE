# RELEASE - Location of external products
#
# (Architecture dependent declarations should go into RELEASE.<arch>)
#
# Note: This file will be scanned to automatically generate
#       include path definitions etc.
#       The order of the following declarations will be retained
#       within those definitions.
#
#
# The following entries will automatically add 
# EPICS_INCLUDES += <entry>/include
# EPICS_DBDFLAGS += <entry>/dbd
# <entry>_BIN = <entry>/bin/$(ARCH)
# The sequence of the entries therefore determine the order in which 
# dbd-files and header files are searched. In most cases it makes sense to 
# add additional share areas _before_ EPICS_BASE and SHARE.
#
#
# Add your declarations here
